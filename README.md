# Dotfiles

This is a dotfiles repository, built to bootstrap any Mac workstation to fit my configurations

## Installation
Just run `setup.sh`

## TODO
1. add the actual dotfiles inside, this only installs software right now
2. find a way to securly get my ssh key in order to clone stuff from GitHub
3. login to chrome as my user automatically
